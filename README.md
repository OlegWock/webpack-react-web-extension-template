  Webpack React WebExtension template
</h1>

Yes, yet another template. But made with love! And some cool features.

## Features

### TypeScript out of the box

TypeScript automatically compiled into JS and then processed by babel.

### Automatic optimization of shared dependencies

Webpack will automatically extract any dependencies shared by 2 or more entry points (i.e. pages, contentscript or background page/worker) into separate file instead of including it with each entrypoint. Those files are loaded automatically, so you don't need to include them in your manifest (but you `chunks` folder should be in `web_accessible_resources`).

### Support for dynamic imports

Dynamic imports work out of the box for pages, contentscripts and background page/worker. This allows posponing loading and parsing some code to time when you actually need it:

```ts
import('@utils/bigModule').then(module => module.lazyFunction());
```

### SCSS/SASS support

Just create new SASS or SCSS file and import it, no adjustments needed.

### Easily inject React components on pages

This templates comes wih [inject-react-anywhere](https://github.com/OlegWock/inject-react-anywhere) which enables you to easily inject your React componts on 3rd-party sites (includes `styled-components` and `emotion` support)

### Automatic discovery of entry points

Just create new file in `contentscripts` or `pages` directory (or sub-directory) and it automatically will be picked up and compiled. No need to update webpack config (but you still need to update manifest). And you don't need to create html files for each page, webpack will do that for you.

### All libraries and shared code in separate file

Webpack configured to move all shared code into two chunks: UI-related and everything else. This way you're not increasing size of your extension too much. Separating code into UI-related and everything else allows us to not include React in friends into background worker.

### Automatic translation of assets imports

All content of `assets` folder is copied into distribution version without changes. And when you import any file from this folder, webpack automatically translates it to `chrome.runtime.getURL(<path>)` call, so you can do something like this:

```tsx
import logo from '@assets/images/icon128.png';

const Popup = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <img src={logo} />
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Eslint and git hook

Do not let bad code slip into repo!

## How to start

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OlegWock/webpack-react-web-extension-template.git project-name
cd project-name
```

Change info in `package.json`. You want to change `name`, `description`, `author`, `repository` and other fields.

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Compile extension:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You'll find compiled version in `dist/chrome`. You can now load it into Chrome. That's all. At leas that's minimal example. Let's take a closer look on other features.

### Development and production

There is two commands to compile extension `dev` and `production`. They do mostly same, but slightly adjust webpack config. For example, production version doesn't have any sourcemaps. You can access this value in code using `X_MODE` variable (without any imports). It will be either `development` or `production`.

```javascript
if (X_MODE === 'development') {
    // Enable more detailed logging here
}
```

### Watch

`yarn watch` will run webpack in watch mode, which will compile code as you type and can significatly speedup development. However, note that changes to webpack config (and thus manifest too) aren't loaded by webpack, you'll need to restart it.

### Manifest

You might noticed that there is no manifest.json in source files. Manifes in generated on the fly by Webpack. You can find related code in `webpack.config.ts` in `generateManifest` function. When you need to put any changes to manifest â€“ it's right place to do so. Note: if you're runing webpack in watch mode, you'll need to restart it after making changes to manifest.

### Background worker

Background worker doesn't require any configuration and should work out of the box.

### Pages

This folder contains scripts each of which will be treated as separate entrypoint (thus, it won't go into common chunk but to separate output file) and for each script there will be html file created with the same name where script will be included. This is particularly handy to make, well, pages. Good examples are popup and options page. But you might as well want to implement welcome page which will be opened on install or just a separate 'web app' inside extension for user to use.

### Contentscripts

Contentscripts are discovered automatically (just like pages) and compiled into `contentscripts` folder in dist. You, however, need to manually adjust manifest to enable your contentscript for desired web-site.

### Components and utils

These folders are for shared code. You can organize them in any structure to your liking.

### Assets

Content of this folder will be copied without any processing. However, if you import any file from this folder in your code it will be replaced with call to `chrome.runtime.getURL`, so you can use it directly as `src` of image for example. If you need to get asset's content, you can use fetch to load assets from URL. See examples in [`components/AnnoyingPopup/index.tsx`](src/components/AnnoyingPopup/index.tsx).

### Raw imports

It's possible to import content of any file directly, without any processing. This way content will be emedded directly into javascript file. Just add `?raw` to any import and

```js
import txtContent from '@assets/test.txt?raw';
```

### Import aliases

There is three import aliases out of the box (but you can add your own): `@assets`, `@components` and `@utils`. They used to avoid cluttered imports like this

```js
import smth from '../../../../../utils/smth';

// Instead you now can do something like
import smth from '@utils/smth';
```

If you want to add your own alias, you need to include it in `webpack.config.ts` (used by webpack for JS files), look for `alias` keyword and in `tsconfig.json` (used by TS and your code editor), look for `paths` field.

### webextension-polyfill

`webextension-polyfill` provides convenient wrapper for `chrome.*` API which uses promises instead of callbacks. This in turn allows you to utilize power of async/await and write elegant async code instead of callbacks hell.

```js
import browser from 'webextension-polyfill';

const main = async () => {
    await browser.storage.local.set({ test: 11 });
    console.log('Storage updated');
};

main();
```

### ESLint

Run `yarn lint` to lint them using ESLint.

## Adjustments

### I don't need options/popup page

Just remove its folder in `src/pages` and remove it from manifest in webpack config.
